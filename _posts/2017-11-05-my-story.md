I would like to share my story and tips.

You might know this exciting feeling while discovering something new, interesting, which absorbs your attention till morning hours? This is what happened to me while creating green roofs map to my master thesis at Poznan University of Economics. I crossed the issue of moving my map from Google Maps to CartoDB. Data layers were based on Google's sattellite images. CartoDB had another geospatial source and the angles of photo shots were different. Not 'the same kind of vector' different but unlike to Google's in each place. 

This is when I met programming for the first time - to transfer my layers automatically I had to use JavaScript. This is how my story begun, I started first tutorials and found out, that I  enjoy doing these smaller and bigger 'logical puzzles' a lot. Long story short, after some time I decided that I could be a full time programmer. 


Then I turned to advice of my friend, Michał, who recommended me starting with Python. And this was it, I felt enchanted with Python 🐍😄 It was like solving logical mind tricks, which I solved tons of on Oddysey of the Mind classes. And I felt very similiar with Python - logical sequences exercising brain (especially in the beginning when everything is brand new). If you like such things, you will probably also like programming 🙂

I took my very first steps to Codeacademy's [Learn Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) course. Then there was [Introduction to Programming with Python](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-us/training-courses/introduction-to-programming-with-python-8360?l=lqhuMxFz_8904984382), Code School's [Python & Django](https://www.codeschool.com/learn/python), CheckIO's [Python path](https://checkio.org/) and [different tasks](http://www.practicepython.org/) from Practice Python. Then I started exercises preparing to Back-End Bootcamp in [CodersLab](https://coderslab.pl/pl). Main part of the programme were: Python, Django, MySQL, OOP, JavaScript and jQuery. Programming with colleagues under watchful eye of mentor boosts skills much faster. It was intensive, but I learned a lot and made new friendships. I would like to underline here, if you are changing career path, bootcamp may speed up entering professional career path, but it is
