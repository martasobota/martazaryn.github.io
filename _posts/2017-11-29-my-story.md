It's been a year since I decided to change my career path. I would like to share with you my story and tips.

### My first contact with code 
I was creating green roofs map to my master thesis at Poznan University of Economics. I crossed the issue of moving my map from Google Maps to CartoDB. Data layers were based on Google's sattellite images. CartoDB had another geospatial source and the angles of photo shots were different. Not 'the same kind of vector' different but unlike to Google's in each place. To transfer my layers automatically I had to use JavaScript. This is how my story begun, I started first tutorials and found out, that I  enjoy doing these smaller and bigger 'logical puzzles' a lot. It was like solving mind tricks, which I solved tons of on Oddysey of the Mind classes. If you like such things, you will probably also like programming 🙂. You might know this exciting feeling while discovering something new, interesting, which absorbs your attention? Long story short, after a few months I decided that I could be a full time programmer. 

### First tutorials 
I took my very first steps to Codeacademy's [Learn Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) course. Then there was [Introduction to Programming with Python](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-us/training-courses/introduction-to-programming-with-python-8360?l=lqhuMxFz_8904984382), Code School's [Python & Django](https://www.codeschool.com/learn/python), CheckIO's [Python path](https://checkio.org/) and [different tasks](http://www.practicepython.org/) from Practice Python. 

What I would recommend now is: Codeacademy and eventually Codeschool plus Udemy's course [From Zero To Hero in Python](https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/), which my friend, Agata recommended me. Udemy often has promotions, where you can buy this course for 15$ or even hunt it for free. 

Also it is a good idea to write hand notes since the very beginning. When you write something by your hand, your brain is more engaged and these things are better learned. These notes will be useful for you, you will remember, that you already wrote something about this issue, you can check it, you can read it. I divided my Moleskine to a few parts: Python, GIT, bash, SQL. I still use this notebook, I was comming back to it often, it is handful and became my 'book of best practices', that I wanted to develop. Structure of list comprehensions, enumerate function, SQL queries, anything you want to learn by your heart.

### Bootcamp
After a few weeks I started exercises preparing to Back-End Bootcamp in [CodersLab](https://coderslab.pl/pl). Main part of the programme were: Python, Django, MySQL, OOP, JavaScript and jQuery. Programming with colleagues under watchful eye of mentor boosts skills much faster. It was intensive, but I learned a lot and made new friendships. I would like to underline here, if you are changing career path, bootcamp may speed up entering professional career path, but it is not mandatory. Although I recommend it, because if you go out on a limb, bootcamp gives you good schedule, exams, professional advices, forces you to do a lot in short time.
