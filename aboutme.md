Hi! My name is Marta Żaryn. For three years I was a landscape architect. During preparation of one of my green roofs analysis, I got to know programming for the first time. I liked it so much, that after some time of practice I decided to rebrand. I am:

- Python Developer,
- [DjangoGirlsWaw](https://www.facebook.com/DjangoGirlsWarsaw/) and [PyLight](https://www.facebook.com/pylightmeetup/) co-organiser
- [Green Roofs Enthusiast](http://efb-greenroof.eu/coming-soon-mapping-green-roofs-in-warsaw/)

I find it inspiring to encourage newbies to programming, so if you have a question or just want to say hi, send me an [e-mail](mailto:martazaryn@gmail.com).
